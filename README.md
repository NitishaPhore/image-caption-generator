# image-caption-generator
A deep learning model that generates natural captions for images by combining DenseNet201 (CNN) for visual feature extraction and LSTM for text generation. The model is trained on imageâ€“caption pairs and deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to upload images and get meaningful, AI-generated captions instantly.
